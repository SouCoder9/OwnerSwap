# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> OwnerSwap
cd OwnerSwap

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **`backend`** directory based on the `.env.example` and fill in your credentials:

### 3\. Start the Servers

You will need **two separate terminals** to run both the backend and frontend concurrently.

```

#### Start Frontend Application

```bash
# In the /OwnerSwap/frontend directory
npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:5173
```
